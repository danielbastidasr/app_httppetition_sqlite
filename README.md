# Who wants to be Millionaire

  In this App we will be using Sqlite, Http petitions and SharedPreferences.

## SQLITE 

  SQLite database management classes that an application would use to manage its own private database.
Applications use these classes to manage private databases.
If creating a content provider, you will probably have to use these classes to create and manage your own database to store content.

## Http Petitions
 
  In order to make Http request such as Get or Put we need to create a Class that extends AsyncTask. Because its necessary in order to not
freeze the UI.

## SharedPreferences 

  We used sharedPreferences in order to save some basic information about our state, such as the question we are in or the money accumulated,
to be able to use it in case screen rotation of our device (land to portrait ,or vicebersa).
